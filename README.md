Web scraping using different packages based on the scenarios from the basic to the advanced concepts.

## 1. Regular Expression
Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that is used to match a specific pattern from the inputs.

## 2. BeautifulSoup
BeautifulSoup is used to pull the data we need out of the HTML or XML files. This will include the knowledge of the developer tool on websites and the application of the use of regular expression.

## 3. Selenium
Selenium is an advanced tool for web scraping. With the selenium package, we can control web browsers through the programs we are favored by and do the web scraping simultaneously.

## 4. API
APIs provide the access to a specific website and allows us to extract the data and information of it. We can retrive and send the data via API call using the codes.

# Final Project - Exploring UFC Statistics: A Comprehensive Analysis of Fights and Fighters
## Overview
This report showcases the use of web scraping to create a structured database for predicting UFC combat outcomes. We collected comprehensive data on completed weekly UFC events, including match outcomes and fighter statistics, using Python and BeautifulSoup. The collected data was stored in a NoSQL database, MongoDB, allowing for flexible and scalable data storage. This organized dataset can be utilized by betting enthusiasts or fighter coaches for future UFC predictions using machine learning techniques.
